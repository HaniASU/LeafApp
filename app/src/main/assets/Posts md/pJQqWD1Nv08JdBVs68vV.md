## Find a Fire-Safe Area

If the allure of sitting by an outdoor firepit at night calls to you, the first thing to consider is safety. 

A fire that burns in an unsafe manner or area is a serious concern. In little time at all, 

a fire can become unmanageable and incredibly dangerous. With that threat in mind, 

it is paramount that you select a fire-safe area for your fire pit.

## Look for an Open Space
You should choose a place that has plenty of open space without objects that will crowd the fire while it burns. With fewer objects like trees and bushes around, it becomes less likely that fire will make contact with something that could begin to burn. The openness of the space you select will also make it easier to move around your firepit once it is built.

## Clear the Air Above the Fire
What is above and below your firepit is also critical. It’s best to keep the space above your firepit clear. A tree canopy or other overhead structure can catch fire as sparks rise from the firepit. That is why you should avoid putting your firepit in any area with objects above it.

## Use the Right Ground Material
The ground itself is another important safety consideration for your firepit. Often, it is best to set your firepit in a hardscape area like a stone or concrete patio. That material is unlikely to catch fire the way plants like grass or other ground cover would. While it is possible to have a firepit on a lawn, avoiding such an area makes it less likely that an accident will occur.

## Buy or Build a Firepit
After dealing with safety concerns, it is time to incorporate the most essential element of any firepit area: the firepit itself. There are several ways you can go about building a firepit. Here are some of the most reliable options:

* Build a firepit as a personal DIY project
* Hire a contractor to build a firepit for you
* Purchase and assemble a free-standing above-ground firepit 

Some builders will set a firepit into the ground in the center of a patio. Or they may build a firepit structure that rises above ground level. Either way, it is usually best to hire a professional contractor to construct one of these firepits.

Creating a Firepit Area to Enjoy on Fall Evenings
A quicker and easier way to add a firepit to your yard is to purchase a free-standing firepit. Free-standing firepits are widely available and typically come with a few simple assembly steps. Once you have set up your firepit, you’ll be able to move it easily as you please. This flexibility and ease of construction are the main advantages of purchasing a free-standing firepit rather than having one built.

## Consider Some Additional Lighting
You might imagine that the fire from your firepit will provide more than enough light on a fall evening, but that is not always the case. Our final tip to you is to consider adding some additional lighting to your firepit space. Here are some of the most popular lighting options for a firepit area:

* String lighting
* Small area/pathway lights
* Floodlights
* Well lights
* Step/railing downlighting

The style of lighting you choose is up to you. But regardless of your selection, additional light will increase visibility on the darkest nights, making your firepit area much safer and more enjoyable. Additionally, some tasteful landscape lighting can also enhance the mood and experience of using your firepit on a cool fall evening.
