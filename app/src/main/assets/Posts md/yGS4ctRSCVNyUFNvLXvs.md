## Don’t Skip Cleaning Up Leaves
Tempting as it is to skip this task, you’re putting your lawn at risk if you don’t deal with your leaves. Thick layers of leaves are slow to rot and can kill off the grass underneath. Take the time to remove fallen leaves this autumn to avoid a lawn disaster in the spring.

## Do Mow Them in Place
One of the easiest, low-maintenance ways to deal with fallen leaves is to mow right over them with a lawnmower. This shreds them into smaller pieces that break down into the soil faster and prevents them from matting up into thick, wet piles.

Most lawnmowers have a mulching option that makes it possible to crush and shred the leaves. You may need to make several passes to ensure the leaves are small enough.

After mowing, you can gently rake the leaf bits throughout the lawn to break up any thick patches and ensure they are dispersed evenly.


## Do Put Them Through a Leaf Shredder
If your mower isn’t set up for mulching leaves, consider using a dedicated leaf shredder to do the job instead. Just toss in leaves and watch them come out as perfectly shredded mulch. You can put these leaf bits in a compost bin or scatter them throughout your yard.

## Don’t Hurt Your Back
It’s all too easy to injure yourself while raking by hand. Many people spend hours cleaning up their yard, only to end up with extreme lower back pain from staying in a bent position for too long.

Pay attention to your posture while raking, and give yourself lots of breaks to stretch out. It’s also wise to use a rake that’s long enough that you don’t need to stoop over. Keep your knees slightly bent to take the pressure off your back. Stay intentional about your posture, and your body will hold out until your raking is finished.

## Do Use Leaves as Natural Mulch for Plants and Animals
When leaves fall in the forest, they break down and add nutrients to the soil that improves the health of native plants. You can follow the same protocol with your plants at home by spreading fallen leaves around your garden beds.

As with all mulches, make sure you don’t pile the leaves directly against plants and tree trunks. Instead, leave a few inches of space so they don’t become suffocated. Shredded leaves work best because they break down more quickly and are less likely to blow away.

An extra benefit? Leaf mulch acts as insulation to protect vulnerable plants and beneficial insects from chilly winter temperatures.


## Don’t Throw Them in Your Regular Trash
Tempting as it may be to simply toss raked leaves into your trash can, it’s not good news for the environment. Leaves take a long time to break down in landfills, and they produce polluting methane gas in the meantime.

If you need to dispose of yard waste, wait for a local collection day or toss it into designated bins instead of with the rest of your household trash.

## Do Wear the Right Gear
Cleaning up fall leaves is a dirty process that involves lots of potential irritants like dust and pollen. It’s best to wear protective gear like gloves and long sleeves to protect you from these irritants.


## Don’t Start Raking on a Wet or Windy Day
Fallen leaves are dry and lightweight. This makes them easy to rake, but it means they tend to blow everywhere on windy days. Save yourself the hassle of raking the same leaves multiple times by waiting until the weather is calm. Likewise, avoid raking after rain unless you’re willing to move heavy clumps of leaves around your yard.

## Don’t Burn Them
Burning leaves might be an easy way to make them disappear, but the smoke they produce contributes to air pollution and is dangerous for anyone with lung conditions. Furthermore, if there’s even a slight wind, you run the risk of the fire spreading and causing serious damage.

## Do Consider Composting
Shredded fall leaves are one of the best things you can add to a home compost pile. Incorporate them as a carbon-rich brown material to balance out an abundance of kitchen scraps, and you’ll have high-quality garden fertilizer in no time.

## Do Wait Until They’ve Finished Falling
Tempting as it is to start raking as soon as the first leaves fall, you’ll need to complete the same chore multiple times. It’s best to wait for most of the leaves to fall off the trees before starting.
