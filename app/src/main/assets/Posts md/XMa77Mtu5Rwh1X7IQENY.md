As landscapes grow and evolve, it pays to create a long-term plan that takes into account mature plant sizes and seasonal maintenance.

Most people will agree that landscape and garden design is an art form, but unlike other types of artwork, a landscape is never finished.

Landscapes are continually growing, changing, and evolving. This is one of the primary reasons why it pays to take your time creating a design for your garden before you start planting — consider the mature sizes of plants and shrubs, as well as how their growth will change the garden dynamics. Even tiny, flowering ornamental plants and bulbs can grow tall and spread out far wider than you initially dreamed possible.

As your landscape grows, you must think dynamically. This means having a plan for seasonal maintenance, annual cutbacks, and a multi-year plan.

## Plan Ahead
When you first design your garden, use graph paper and make a drawing to scale so that you can sketch out where everything will go.

Calculate the mature sizes of the plants you have chosen, and draw them in at the mature size. This will help you to make sure there is enough space to accommodate the plants you want.

As Your Landscape Grows, Think Dynamically
Think about the flowering seasons and fall colors, and draw out your garden in every season. You don’t have to be a great artist, just think in colors, shapes, and sizes.

Look at where the shrubs and trees will cast shade, and plan for how that will change the garden as they grow. The more you plan in advance, the easier it will be for you to make decisions about the landscape as it grows and changes.

## Shape and Manicure
In addition to designing a landscape with the mature sizes of plants in mind, you should also consider how you may want to shape shrubs and ornamental trees as the landscape matures.

As shrubs and ornamental trees grow, they can become unruly and cast shade onto understory plants, affecting their growth and flowering. Cutting them back will keep the landscape in balance and can add a beautiful overall design element.

There are many different methods for manicuring ornamental trees — from pollarding to topiary — so look at the different ways that you can mold them to fit into your aesthetic.

Shaping small trees and shrubs isn’t only practical, it adds geometry, whimsy, and stronger lines to your landscape


## Multiply, Divide, and Add
Just as a family might add an extra bedroom to their home when they have another child, you should consider expanding your garden beds over time to make room for new plants and to adjust for the growth of older, more mature ones.

Some of this expansion will happen naturally — for instance, with flowering bulbs that multiply over time. Every few years, bulbs like to be divided, which means digging them up and removing half or more of them to create space for the bulbs to thrive.

While this can be a great opportunity to share with friends and neighbors, it also means that you can increase the number of bulbs in your garden — often by expanding existing flower beds or creating new ones.

If you are running out of flower bed space, you might want to consider giving up some of your lawn to create larger planting areas that leave only pathways between planted areas.
