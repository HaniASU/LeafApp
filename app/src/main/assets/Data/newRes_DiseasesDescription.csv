Alstonia Scholaris___Galls,Alstonia Scholaris,Galls,"## Overview
 Plant galls are abnormal outgrowths of plant tissues, similar to benign tumors or warts in animals. They can be caused by various parasites, from viruses, fungi and bacteria, to other plants, insects and mites.
## Symptoms 
 The symptoms of gall disease on Alstonia Scholaris can vary depending on the pathogen involved. However, some common symptoms include:
* Abnormal growths or swellings on the leaves, stems, and/or roots of the plant
* Discoloration of the affected areas, which may turn yellow, brown, or black.
* Twisted or distorted growth of stems or leaves
* Reduced growth or stunted growth of the plant
* Premature leaves drop or defoliation.
* Die back of twigs or branches
* Formation of hard, woody galls on the plant, which may contain the pathogen responsible for the disease. 
## Cause 
 Various parasites, insects & mites
## Tips 
 * Select resistant cultivars when possible and purchase plants from a reputable nursery.
 * Do not buy plants that shows signs of swelling or galling.
 * When caring for susceptible plants, avoid injury or pruning wounds that may come in contact with the soil.
 * Use Tree Wrap to protect against string trimmer damage and keep your garden tools clean.
 * Provide winter protection with natural burlap so bark does not crack.
 * In many cases, existing galls can be removed with a sharp pruning knife. Destroy the infected plant tissue and treat the wound with pruning sealer. If the plant does not recover, remove and destroy it.

coffee___Rust,Coffee,Rust,"## Overview 
 Coffee Rust disease does not affect rice plants, but coffee plants. However, to answer your question, coffee rust disease starts when spores of the fungal pathogen Hemileia vastatrix come into contact with a coffee plant. The spores can be spread by wind or rain, or they can be present in infected plant debris or soil. Once the spores land on a coffee plant, they germinate and penetrate the leaf tissue, where they form yellow-orange powdery spots on the upper surface of the leaves.
## Symptoms 
 * Yellow-orange powdery spots on the upper surface of the leaves.
* Premature dropping of leaves.
* Defoliation, which can lead to reduced growth and yield.
* Thin, spindly branches due to reduced photosynthesis.
* Reduced quality of the coffee beans due to reduced growth and yield. 
## Cause 
 Fungal pathogen( Hemileia vastatrix ) 
## Tips 
 Coffee rust can be partially controlled by the timely application of fungicide sprays during wet seasons. Plantations in some areas have been moved to higher and cooler altitudes, 1,800 to 2,100 metres (6,000 to 7,000 feet), at which the rust fungus has difficulty reproducing, though global warming is expected to further the spread of the disease into these areas. There is evidence that shade-grown coffees, which are not grown as monocultures, are somewhat less susceptible, as the agroforestry practice of mixing tree crops greatly slows the spread of the disease. Additionally, resistant varieties of Robusta coffee (Coffea canefora) have been developed, but the beans are generally considered to be of lower quality than those of the vulnerable Arabica plants (C. arabica). One resistant variety, Lempira, was widely planted in Honduras but lost its resistance to the disease in 2017, resulting in crop losses in that country. No resistant varieties have been shown to be impervious to all races of the fungus.
",The disease starts when spores of the fungal pathogen Hemileia vastatrix come into contact with a coffee plant.,rady
coffee___red_spider_mite,Coffee,Red spider mite,"## Overview 
 The infestation of red spider mites starts when the tiny arthropods called Tetranychus urticae come into contact with a coffee plant. These mites feed on the underside of the coffee plant leaves, causing damage to the plant tissue. The feeding activity of the mites can lead to the development of stippling or small, white or yellow spots on the leaves. The mites can also cause webbing on the leaves and stems of the coffee plant. 
## Symptoms 
 * Fine webbing on the leaves and stems.
* Yellowing or bronzing of the leaves.
* Stippling or small, white or yellow spots on the leaves.
* Leaf drop and defoliation, which can lead to reduced growth and yield.
* Presence of tiny, red or brown mites on the leaves and stems.
## Cause 
 Insect( Red spider mite ) 
## Tips 
 * Use miticides: Apply appropriate miticides to the affected coffee plants to control the mite population, but follow recommended application rates and safety guidelines to avoid environmental harm. Apply the miticide at the right time to target the mites when they are most vulnerable.
* Use natural predators: Introduce natural predators of coffee red spider mites, such as ladybugs or predatory mites, to the coffee fields to help control the mite population.
* Improve soil and water management: Maintain good soil fertility and drainage, and avoid overwatering or underwatering the coffee plants. This can help to reduce the risk of mite infestation and promote healthy plant growth.
* Use intercropping techniques: Interplant coffee with legumes or other crops to create a diverse ecosystem that can help control mite populations and reduce the risk of infestation.
* Monitor the coffee fields regularly: Regularly inspect the coffee fields for signs of mite infestation, such as stippling or webbing on the leaves, and take appropriate measures to control the infestation as soon as it is detected.
* Practice good agricultural practices: Use good agricultural practices such as proper pruning, weeding, and sanitation to help prevent the buildup of mite populations and reduce the risk of infestation.

Corn_(maize)___Cercospora_leaf_spot_Gray_leaf_spot,Corn_(maize),Cercospora leaf spot (Gray),"## Overview
 It survives in plant residues in the soil for long periods of time.
During the spring, the spores are carried onto the lower leaves by rain splashes and wind.
Its lifecycle is favored by elevated temperatures (25 to 30Â°C), high humidity (dews, fogs), and leaf wetness for prolonged periods of time.
Hot, dry weather hinders its development.
Symptoms vary slightly between different plant varieties.
The fungus completes its lifecycle (from infection to the production of new spores) in 14-21 days in a susceptible variety and in 21-28 days in a resistant one.  
## Symptoms 
 Small necrotic (brown or tan) spots that may have a yellow chlorotic halo appear on lower leaves, usually before flowering. 
Gradually these lesions will turn grayish and appear on younger leaves, too. 
As the disease progresses, they enlarge into elongated, rectangular lesions that run parallel to the leaf veins. 
In optimal conditions (warm temperatures, high humidity and wet leaves), they can coalesce and engulf the whole leaf. 
If this happens before grain filling there can be considerable yield losses. 
The leaf blight can weaken the plants and sometimes soften the stalks, leading to lodging. 
## Cause 
 Fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis 
## Tips 
 * Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available.
* Foliar fungicide treatment is a way to manage the disease if it occurs at its early stages, but it has to be weighed against the weather conditions, the potential yield loss, and the susceptibility of the plant.
* Fungicides containing pyraclostrobin and strobilurin, or combinations of azoxystrobin and propiconazole, prothioconazole, and trifloxystrobin work well to control the fungus.

Cotton___Aphids,Cotton,Aphids,"## Overview 
 Cotton aphid leaf disease starts when cotton aphids (Aphis gossypii and Aphis craccivora) infest cotton plants and begin to feed on the sap of the leaves. As the aphids feed, they secrete a sticky substance called honeydew, which can attract other pests and fungal diseases, including sooty mold. The honeydew can also cover the leaves, reducing their photosynthetic capacity and leading to reduced plant growth and yield. 
## Symptoms 
 * Stunted growth: Infested cotton plants may exhibit stunted growth and reduced vigor.
* Yellowing leaves: The leaves of infested cotton plants may turn yellow and become distorted.
* Leaf curling: The leaves of infested cotton plants may curl and become deformed.
* Honeydew: Cotton aphids excrete a sticky substance called honeydew, which can accumulate on the leaves and stems of the plant.
* Sooty mold: The honeydew excreted by cotton aphids can also lead to the growth of a black, sooty mold on the leaves and stems of the plant.
* Reduced yield: In severe cases, cotton aphids can significantly reduce the yield and quality of cotton crops. 
## Cause 
 Aphid Species (including Aphis gossypii, Aphis craccivora) 
## Tips 
 * Consult industry Insecticide Resistance Management Strategies because it is important not to rely on insecticides alone.
* Aphid levels should be monitored at least weekly from seedling emergence through to defoliation.
* Controlling brassica weeds and other hosts such as marshmallows, capeweed and thistles between seasons will help reduce aphid pressure. 
* Cotton aphid populations build rapidly as spring temperatures increase. At this time, beneficial insects can play a very important role in suppressing aphid populations, so it is important to consider their populations too when assessing aphid spray thresholds.
* In addition to beneficial numbers, consider the current growing conditions. If crops have good growing conditions at the time of infestation (i.e., good soil moisture), they are more likely to be able to compensate for aphid damage compared to moisture stressed plants.

Cotton___Bacterial blight,Cotton,Bacterial blight,"## Overview 
 Cotton bacterial blight leaf disease starts when the bacterium, Xanthomonas campestris pv. malvacearum, infects cotton plants through natural openings or wounds on the leaves. The bacteria can survive in plant debris and soil for several years and can be transmitted through contaminated seed, equipment, or water. The disease can also be spread by wind, rain, or insect vectors.
Once the bacteria infect a cotton plant, they can cause water-soaked lesions that later turn brown or black. The lesions can spread rapidly, leading to defoliation of the plant and reduced yield. Warm and humid weather conditions can promote the spread of the disease. 
## Symptoms 
 * Water-soaked lesions: The symptoms of the disease start as small, water-soaked lesions on the leaves, stems, and bolls of the cotton plant.
* Lesion expansion: As the disease progresses, the lesions expand and become angular in shape, with a yellow halo around them.
* Leaf drop: Infected leaves may drop prematurely, leading to the defoliation of the plant.
* Reduced yield: In severe cases, bacterial blight can lead to significant yield losses and reduced fiber quality.
* Shoot dieback: The disease can also cause shoot dieback and blackening of the stem.
* Wilting: Infected plants may wilt and die prematurely. 
## Cause 
 Xanthomonas Bacteria 
## Tips 
 * Diseased plant debris should be removed and burnt.
* Deep ploughing after harvest helps reduce disease incidence.
* Crop rotation, late sowing, early thinning, good tillage, early irrigation, and adding potash to soil help reduce disease incidence.
* Since the bacteria inhabit seeds internally or externally, seed treatment is an effective means to control the disease. 
* Bacteria occurring externally on seeds can be destroyed by immersing seeds in sulphuric acid for 10-15 minutes, then rinsing thoroughly by suspending them in water to remove acid, drying, and finally treating with Agrosan GN, Ceresan, etc. To remove bacteria lying inside the seeds, the use of antibiotics is recommended. Seeds may be soaked overnight in 1000 ppm of streptomycin for the purpose.
The use of resistant varieties is the best and most effective control measure. Some of them are – HC 9, BJA 592, Reba-B 50, Badnawar-I, K-4005, DHY 286, Khandawa-2, 70 IH- 480/3, and so on.

Cotton___Powdery mildew,Cotton,Powdery mildew,"## Overview 
 Plants infected with powdery mildew look as if they have been dusted with flour.
Powdery mildew usually starts off as circular, powdery white spots, which can appear on leaves, stems, and sometimes fruit.
Powdery mildew usually covers the upper part of the leaves but may grow on the undersides as well.
Young foliage is most susceptible to damage. Leaves turn yellow and dry out.
The fungus might cause some leaves to twist, break, or become disfigured.
The white spots of powdery mildew will spread to cover most of the leaves or affected areas.
The leaves, buds, and growing tips will become disfigured as well. These symptoms usually appear late in the growing season.  
## Symptoms 
 * White powdery spots: The disease typically starts as small, white powdery spots on the leaves, stems, and bolls of the cotton plant.
* Leaf distortion: As the disease progresses, the affected leaves may become distorted, curled, or twisted.
* Stunted growth: Infected cotton plants may exhibit stunted growth and reduced vigor.
* Reduced yield: In severe cases, powdery mildew can significantly reduce the yield and quality of cotton crops.
* Premature defoliation: Infected leaves may drop prematurely, leading to defoliation of the plant.
* The stem blackening: In some cases, the stem of the infected plant may become blackened. 
## Cause 
 Fungus ( the Oidium gossypii ) 
## Tips 
 * Once plants are heavily infected, it’s very difficult to get rid of the disease, so focus on preventing it from spreading to other plants. 
* Remove all infected foliage, stems, and fruit and destroy them, either by throwing them in the trash or by burning. 
* Do not compost any infected plant, as the disease can still be spread by the wind and persist in the composted materials.
* After pruning off infected parts, do not allow pruning shears to touch healthy leaves. First sterilize your pruners with rubbing alcohol.

Cotton___Target spot,Cotton,Target spot,"## Overview 
 The disease affects mainly older leaves of mature plants. Reddish lesions will appear on these leaves during the early stages of the infection. As the disease progresses, the lesions enlarge and turn white to light brown or gray in the center with a purple, dark brown or blackish margin. The lesions are circular or irregular in shape and vary in size depending on the time of infection. A concentric zonation of the spots occurs, alternating dark and light brown or red margins. Affected leaves eventually become pale in color and finally fall off.  
## Symptoms 
 * Circular spots: The disease typically starts as small, circular spots on the leaves of the cotton plant.
* Brown lesions: As the disease progresses, the spots may turn brown and develop a target-like appearance, with concentric rings of light and dark brown.
* Leaf drop: Infected leaves may drop prematurely, leading to defoliation of the plant.
* Reduced yield: In severe cases, target spot disease can significantly reduce the yield and quality of cotton crops.
* Stem cankers: The disease can also cause cankers or lesions on the stem of the cotton plant.
* Boll rot: In some cases, target spot disease can lead to boll rot and reduced fiber quality. 
## Cause 
 Fungus ( Corynespora cassiicola ) 
## Tips 
 Rotate to a non-host such as corn if possible.
Plant multiple, high-yielding, stable-performing varieties adapted to the field environment. Although differences in variety susceptibility have been noted, the highest yielding varieties in a given trial have also occasionally been characterized by the highest disease ratings and greatest percent defoliation.
Properly apply nitrogen and plant growth regulators to produce sufficient vegetative growth to support fruiting bodies without allowing the plant to become rank.
When considering fungicide applications, keep in mind that while two applications of fungicide have consistently reduced disease and defoliation due to target spot, yield responses have been variable in Tennessee.

Mango___Anthracnose,Mango,Anthracnose,"## Overview 
 The fungus attacks the young leaves, inflorescence, twigs, and the fruits and the symptoms vary according to the plant parts infected. When the young leaves and inflorescence are infected, small blister-like spots develop on them. On twigs and floral axis the symptoms appear as black necrotic patches; the disease spreads rapidly during the rainy season and covers the twigs and floral axis causing them to turn black and become dry.
When the fruits are attacked, black spots are formed on them and their skin becomes discoloured. The fruit pulp beneath the spot becomes hard. The infected fruit-skin later cracks and the adjacent area decays at ripening. Infected fruits and leaves may fall off the tree prematurely.
  
## Symptoms 
 The disease causes serious losses to young shoots, flowers and fruits It is also affects fruits during storage.
The disease produces leaf spot, blossom blight, wither tip, twig blight and fruit rot symptoms. Tender shoots and foliage are easily affected which ultimately cause „die back‟ of young branches. Older twigs may also be infected through wounds which in severe cases may be fatal.
Depending on the prevailing weather conditions blossom blight may vary in severity from slight to a heavy infection of the panicles. Black spots develop on panicles as well as on fruits. Severe infection destroys the entire inflorescence resulting in no setting of fruits. Young infected fruits develop black spots, shrivel and drop off.
Fruits infected at mature stage carry the fungus into storage and cause considerable loss during storage, transit and marketing. 
## Cause 
 Fungus ( Colletotrichum gloeosporioides ) 
## Tips 
 Seed treatment with BIODISTINCTION XTRA helps to control seed coat infections.
Fungicides should be mixed with INTEGRA 3ml/20l, which improves the efficacy of the fungicide by acting as a sticker, spreader, wetter and penetrant.
Alternating different fungicides throughout a plant’s season prevents the fungus from developing resistance over any of the fungicides.
Proper fertilization and watering during summer must be done to maintain tree vigour, which is important for keeping the infection of twigs away.
Tree sanitation is essential. Diseased twigs should be pruned and burnt along with fallen leaves.
Pruning should be followed by spraying of suitable fungicides such as Bordeaux mixture (6:6: 50), 0.15% Cuprocide, Fytolan or Blitox-50, etc., which proves effective. Four to five sprayings between January to July give satisfactory control to the disease. A combination of Captan with Zineb for spraying the trees has been reported very effective. Prakash and Mishra have reported in 2001 that spraying of Bavistin (0.1%) at fortnight interval is quite effective against mango anthracnose.
Post-harvest fruit treatment in hot water at 51°C for 15 minutes is required to control fruit-rot. 
","The fungus attacks the young leaves, inflorescence, twigs, and the fruits and the symptoms vary according to the plant parts infected. When the young leaves and inflorescence are infected, small blister-like spots develop on them. On twigs and floral axis the symptoms appear as black necrotic patches; the disease spreads rapidly during the rainy season and covers the twigs and floral axis causing them to turn black and become dry.
When the fruits are attacked, black spots are formed on them and their skin becomes discoloured. The fruit pulp beneath the spot becomes hard. The infected fruit-skin later cracks and the adjacent area decays at ripening. Infected fruits and leaves may fall off the tree prematurely.

Mango___Bacterial Canker,Mango,Bacterial Canker,"## Overview 
 The disease is caused by a strain of the bacteria Xanthomonas citri. It can survive up to 8 months in living tissues. It infects trees through wounds and natural openings. The pathogens can spread from tree to tree or between fields by wind-driven rain or through implements used for management activities such as pruning. Alternatively, the spreading occurs via infected plant material or through contact in the case of fruits. The most favorable temperature for an infection with bacterial black spot is between 25 and 30 °C. High humidity also fosters infections. Windbreaks or the planting of tree species with dense foliage around the orchard can reduce the spreading of the disease. 
## Symptoms 
 The disease is noticed on leaves, leaf stalks, stems, twigs, branches and fruits, initially producing water soaked lesions, later turning into typical canker.
On leaves, water soaked irregular satellite to angular raised lesions measuring 1-4 mm in diameter are formed. These lesions are light yellow in colour, initially with yellow halo but with age enlarge or coalesce to form irregular necrotic cankerous patches with dark brown colour.
On fruits, water-soaked, dark brown to black coloured lesions are observed which gradually developed into cankerous, raised or flat spots. These spots grow bigger usually up to 1 to 5 mm in diameter, which covers / almost the whole fruit.
These spots often, burst extruding gummy substances containing highly contagious bacterial cells. 
## Cause 
 Bacterium ( Xanthomonas campestris ) 
## Tips 
 Prune flowering trees during blooming when wounds heal fastest.
Remove wilted or dead limbs well below infected areas.
Avoid pruning in early spring and fall when bacteria are most active.
Treat all pruning cuts immediately with Tanglefoot® Tree Pruning Sealer and make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment — one part bleach to 4 parts water — after each cut.
If using string trimmers around the base of trees avoid damaging bark with breathable Tree Wrap to prevent infection.
Brush bark with white latex paint diluted with water to reduce bark-damaging temperature fluctuations.
Research has shown that copper fungicides have some success against this stone fruit problem. However, results are inconsistent. We recommend using it as one part of a total management program.
Remove weeds and grass from around the base of young trees to improve air circulation and keep the trunk and crown dry.
Organocide® Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Mix 1/3 to 3/4 oz per gallon of water and paint or spray over pruning wounds and surrounding areas.

Mango___Cutting Weevil,Mango,Cutting Weevil,"## Overview 
 Adult mango nut weevil is an oval-shaped beetle with an elongated head that forms a snout. Female lay creamy-white, elliptical eggs singly on half mature (green) to ripe mango fruit. The puncture point is characterized by an incision on the fruit peel along with a light brown secretion. After 5-7 days, 1 mm long larvae hatch and tunnel through the flesh to reach the mango seeds. Usually, one larva is found feeding on each stone, sometimes up to 5. In some rare cases, the larvae will feed and pupate in the pulp. Adults usually emerge after fruits fall and undergo a period of suspended growth until new fruits appear on trees. When mangoes reach pea-size, they become active again and start feeding on leaves and mating. Long-range spreading of the bugs occurs through the transport of fruit, seeds, seedlings and/or cuttings containing larvae, pupae or adults. 
## Symptoms 
 Tunneling: Mango cutting weevil larvae tunnel into the trunk, branches, and fruit of the mango tree, causing extensive damage.
Wilting: Infested branches may wilt and die, leading to a reduction in tree vigor.
Fruit drop: Infested fruits may drop prematurely, leading to reduced yield.
Entry holes: Adult weevils may leave entry holes on the trunk and branches of the mango tree.
Sawdust: Infested areas may have sawdust-like material, which is the result of weevil feeding and tunneling.
  
## Cause 
 Insect ( Sternochetus mangiferae beetle ) 
## Tips 
 Destroying the affected fruits and exposing the hibernating weevils by digging the soil
Spraying the trees with Fenthion (0.01%)

Mango___Die Back,Mango,Die Back,"## Overview 
 Botryosphaeria rhodina survives in plant necrotic tissue for long periods of time. It invades the vascular system of mango trees through wounds in the trunk and branches. The precise mechanism for the infection is not fully understood. Possible entry sites are wounds inflicted by insects (beetles) or mechanical injuries that occured during field work. The primary source of infection might be spores in the dead bark of twigs. They remain on the trees during the growing season and spread during the harvest period. Deficiency in iron, zinc and manganese may favor the outbreak of the disease. Water and freezing stress have also been related to this disease. The disease can occur at any time of the year but it is most conspicuous during late growth stages. 
## Symptoms 
 Infection of mango trees with the fungus Botryosphaeria rhodina manifests itself in dry twigs and can lead to complete defoliation. During the first stage of the disease, the barks become discolored and turn darker. In the following stages, young twigs start withering at the base, extending outwards until the leaves become affected. As the veins turn brown, leaves curl upwards and eventually fall off the tree. In the final stages of dieback, twigs and branches secrete gum. Initially, small gum droplets become visible, but as the disease progresses the entire branch or trunk may be covered. In severe cases, the tree bark or whole branches die and crack. 
  
## Cause 
 Fungus ( Lasiodiplodia theobromae , Colletotrichum gloeosporioides , Fusarium moniliforme ) 
## Tips 
 Measures such as the sterilization of budding knives, placement of budded trees in a dry environment, and gradual exposure to full sunlight have been suggested to control the dieback of grafted seedlings.
The disease can be controlled by pruning diseased twigs 2-3 inches below the affected portion and spraying Copper Oxychloride (0.3%) on infected trees. Copper Oxychloride (0.3%) is pasted on the cut ends of pruned twigs.

Mango___Gall Midge,Mango,Gall Midge,"## Overview 
 The symptoms are caused by different species of midges, Procontarinia sp. Adult midges are 1-2 mm in size and die within 24 hours of emergence after copulation and egg deposition. Eggs are laid on almost all tree parts, but they are predominantly found on leaves. When they hatch, the larvae penetrate the tissues and inflict damage depending on the organ they affect. Floral parts that are fed upon can consequently dry up and fall to the ground due to extensive feeding. Mature larvae migrate or fall onto the upper soil layers, where they enter the pupal stage. The emergence of adults usually takes place in the afternoon and is favored by cool temperatures (20°C) and 60-82% relative humidity. There can be up to 3-4 pest generations over the period of January to March in the northern hemisphere.  
## Symptoms 
 The symptoms appear predominantly on the leaves, but occasionally also on the buds, inflorescences and young fruits of mango trees. The parts infested by this midge become covered with many small, raised galls or blisters. Each wart-like blister or gall is 3-4 mm in size and contains a yellow larva that feeds on tree tissue. In the early stages, the site of egg deposition appears as a small red spot. Heavily-affected leaves may deform, show reduced photosynthesis, and drop prematurely.  Infested inflorescences may be unable to open. The small exit holes on the underside of leaves are remnants due to larval presence. These exit lesions may result in secondary fungal infections. Young fruits also display exit holes at the base of the stem. Severely infected mango shoots have almost no inflorescence, which can considerably reduce the yield.  
## Cause 
 Insect ( Procontarinia matteiana fly ) 
## Tips 
 Planting resistant mango varieties
Maintenance of field hygiene/ sanitation
Proper weed control (weeds are alternate hosts of the pests)
Pruning the infested branches
Mixed and intercropping farming reduces the pest population
Ploughing of the orchards exposes pupating and diapausing larvae to sun heat which kills them
Avoid movement of infested plants to new areas
Hand-picking the midges, especially if the population is not dense
Use of sticky traps to catch the flies
It is highly advisable to always mix the insecticide with INTEGRA 3ml/20l whenever spraying. This is a sticker, wetter, spreader and penetrant which greatly improves the efficacy of the chemical
Alternating the insecticides during the crop’s season helps in preventing resistance build up by the pest, which would be if a single chemical was used.
Timely control of the pest is very critical.

Mango___Powdery Mildew,Mango,Powdery Mildew,"## Overview 
 Oidium mangiferae survives from one season to the next as mycelium in dormant buds and as haustoria on old infected leaves.
After landing on the plant tissue, a conidium of O. mangiferae germinates, enters a stoma/pore and then grows. After two or three weeks, the fruiting bodies grow out of the stomata and release conidia into the air, to be carried to other plants or plant parts.
It usually takes about 7-10days from the time of infection to development of symptoms.
The disease is spread by wind-borne conidia from other mango trees or from within an infected tree’s canopy.
Initial infection with O. mangiferae is promoted by warm temperatures and moderate relative humidity, although development of the disease is favoured by cool, dry conditions.
The fungus survives under dense foliage during off-season. 
## Symptoms 
 The characteristic symptom of the disease is the white superficial powdery fungal growth on leaves, stalks of panicles, flowers and young fruits.
The affected flowers and fruits drop pre-maturely reducing the crop load considerably or might even prevent the fruit set.
The fungus parasitizes young tissues of all parts of the inflorescence, leaves and fruits.
Young leaves are attacked on both the sides but it is more conspicuous on the grower surface. Often these patches coalesce and occupy larger areas turning into purplish brown in colour
  
## Cause 
 Fungus ( Oidium mangiferae ) 
## Tips 
 Chemical Control Methods:
Alternate spraying of Wettable sulfur 0.2 percent (2 g Sulfex/liter), Tridemorph O.1 percent (1 ml Calixin/liter), and Bavistin at 0.1 % at 15 days intervals are recommended for effective control of this disease. The first spray should be given at the panicle emergence stage.

Mango___Sooty Mould,Mango,Sooty Mould,"## Overview 
 The fungi produce mycelium which is superficial and dark. They row on sugary secretions of the plant hoppers. Black encrustation is formed which affect the photosynthetic activity.
The fungus grows on the leaf surface on the sugary substances secreted by jassids, aphids and scale insects.
  
## Symptoms 
 The disease is common in the orchards where mealy bug, scale insect and hopper are not controlled efficiently.
The disease in the field is recognized by the presence of a black velvety coating, i.e., sooty mould on the leaf surface. In severe cases the trees turn completely black due to the presence of mould over the entire surface of twigs and leaves.
The severity of infection depends on the honey dew secretion by the above said insects. Honey dew secretions from insects sticks to the leaf surface and provide necessary medium for fungal growth.
  
## Cause 
 Fungus ( black, sooty mold ) 
## Tips 
 Pruning of affected branches and their prompt destruction, followed by spraying of Wettasulf (0.2% )+ Metacid (0.1 %)+ gum acacia (0.3%), helps to control the disease.
The fungal growth can be checked by spraying with 0.2% wettable sulfur.

Tomato___Late_blight,Tomato,Late blight,"## Overview 
 Can devastate tomato plantings. 
## Symptoms 
 Late blight affects all aerial parts of the tomato plant;
initial symptoms of the disease appear as water-soaked green to black areas on leaves which rapidly change to brown lesions;
fluffy white fungal growth may appear on infected areas and leaf undersides during wet weather;
as the disease progresses, foliage becomes becomes shriveled and brown and the entire plant may die;
fruit lesions start as irregularly shaped water soaked regions and change to greasy spots;
entire fruit may become infected and a white fuzzy growth may appear during wet weather. 
## Cause 
 Oomycete 
## Tips 
 Plant resistant varieties;
if signs of disease are present or if rainy conditions are likely or if using overhead irrigation appropriate fungicides should be applied.

Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot,Tomato,Septoria leaf spot,"## Overview 
 * Spread by water splash.
* The fungus overwinters in plant debris. 
## Symptoms 
 Symptoms may occur at any stage of tomato development and begin as small, water-soaked spots or circular grayish-white spots on the underside of older leaves;
spots have a grayish center and a dark margin and they may colasece;
fungal fruiting bodies are visible as tiny black specks in the center of spot;
spots may also appear on stems, fruit calyxes, and flowers. 
## Cause 
 Fungus Septoria lycopersici 
## Tips 
 Ensure all tomato crop debris is removed and destroyed in Fall or plowed deep into soil;
plant only disease-free material;
avoid overhead irrigation;
stake plants to increase air circulation through the foliage;
apply appropriate fungicide if necessary.

Tomato___Spider_mites_Two-spotted_spider_mite,Tomato,Spider mites Two-spotted spider mite,"## Overview 
 Spider mites thrive in dusty conditions;
water-stressed plants are more susceptible to attack. 
## Symptoms 
 Leaves stippled with yellow;
leaves may appear bronzed;
webbing covering leaves;
mites may be visible as tiny moving dots on the webs or underside of leaves, best viewed using a hand lens;
usually not spotted until there are visible symptoms on the plant;
leaves turn yellow and may drop from plant. 
## Cause 
 Arachnid 
## Tips 
 In the home garden, spraying plants with a strong jet of water can help reduce buildup of spider mite populations;
if mites become problematic apply insecticidal soap to plants;
certain chemical insecticides may actually increase mite populations by killing off natural enemies and promoting mite reproduction.

Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus,Tomato,Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus,"## Overview 
 The virus is transmitted by white flies and may cause 100 % yield loss if the plants infect at early stage of crop.
The virus also infect other hosts like common bean, ornamental plants and several weed species. 
## Symptoms 
 The infected leaves become reduced in size, curl upward, appear crumpled and show yellowing of veins and leaf margins.
The internodes become shorter and whole plant appear stunted and bushy.
The whole plant stand erect with only upright growth.
The flowers may not develop and drop off. 
## Cause 
 Virus 
## Tips 
 Grow available resistant varieties.
Transplant only disease and whiteflies free seedlings.
Remove the infected plants and burn them.
Keep the field free from weeds.
Use yellow sticky traps to monitor and control whiteflies.

Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus,Tomato,Tomato mosaic virus,"## Overview 
 ToMV is a closely related strain of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), it enters fields via infected weeds, peppers or potato plants;
the virus may also be transmitted to tomato fields by grasshoppers, small mammals and birds. 
## Symptoms 
 Symptoms can occur at any growth stage and any part of the plant can be affected;
infected leaves generally exhibit a dark green mottling or mosaic;
some strains of the virus can cause yellow mottling on the leaves;
young leaves may be stunted or distorted;
severely infected leaves may have raised green areas;
fruit yields are reduced in infected plants;
green fruit may have yellow blotches or necrotic spots;
dark necrotic streaks may appear on the stems, petioles leaves and fruit. 
## Cause 
 Virus 
## Tips 
 Plant varieties that are resistant to the virus;
heat treating seeds at 70Â°C (158Â°F) for 4 days or at 82â€“85Â°C (179.6â€“185Â°F) for 24 hours will help to eliminate any virus particles on the surface of the seeds;
soaking seed for 15 min in 100 g/l of tri-sodium phosphate solution (TSP) can also eliminate virus particles - seeds should be rinsed thoroughly and laid out to dry after this treatment;
if the virus is confirmed in the field, infected plants should be removed and destroyed to limit further spread;
plant tomato on a 2-year rotation, avoiding susceptible crops such as peppers, eggplant, cucurbits and tobacco;
disinfect all equipment when moving from infected areas of the field.
